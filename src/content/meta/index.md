Hi! I go by **kala Asi**, or **Aci**, short for **AcipenserSturio**. The name is binomial nomenclature for the [European sea sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sea_sturgeon), hence the "fishy" identity.

I am most active in Toki Pona communities. I started learning Toki Pona in 2019, and have since then started or contributed to various projects for Toki Pona infrastructure and community engagement.

I have a bachelor's degree in Linguistics (currently doing a master's program). I do open source software development as a hobby. Hoping to get a CS job one day.
